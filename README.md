This repository contains coding samples from Coursera courses completed between 2021 and 2022;

1. Dognition & Dillards 
I used SQL through MySQL and Teradata to transform raw business transaction data (e.g., user info, product info, test-completion timestamps, store ino, transaction info, etc.) into tables showing key business metrics. Several jupyter notebooks show how I queried, cleaned, aggregated, analyzed and visualized data. 

Each table contain >10k records. 

2. Machine Learning 
The Python code samples from "Clustering-python.ipynb" are for "Python for Data Science" with Cornell University.

The task was to use K-Means from the Skikit-learn package to cluster data from the "World Happiness Report" into 10 groups, then plot the centroids of each clustered group.
