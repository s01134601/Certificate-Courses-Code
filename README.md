This repository contains coding samples from Coursera courses completed between 2021 and 2022;

The SQL code samples in "Business Metrics Analysis - SQL" are for "Managing Big Data with MySQL" with Duke University. 

The task was to analyze key business metrics for the Dillards database from 2004 to 2005 on Teradata. The database contains 6 tables: transaction data, department info, store_msa(containing demographic data on the region), skstinfo(cost and retail prices for each stocking keeping unit), skuinfo (info on each stock keeping unit); Each table contains > 100k entries.

The Python code samples from "Clustering-python.ipynb" are for "Python for Data Science" with Cornell University.

The task was to use K-Means from the Skikit-learn package to cluster data from the "World Happiness Report" into 10 groups, then compare the results with the original classification (from the original dataset) to see if the latter captures the similarities between individual entities in the dataset.

I also plot the centroids of each clustered group. 

Furthermore, I use seaborn clustermap to graph a dendrogram showing the results of hierarchical clustering.
